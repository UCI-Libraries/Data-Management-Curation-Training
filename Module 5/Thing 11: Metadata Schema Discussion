Please let us know what level your post is addressing, i.e. Getting Started, Learn More, or Challenge Me.

Getting started:

    Why, if metadata is the lifeblood of data discover-ability and reuse, is it often neglected or not richly done when data is published?

Learn More:

    Discuss the particular standard you explored in detail and perhaps add other reasons to recommend or not recommend that standard.

Challenge Me:

    Reflect on XML as a metadata tool. The metadata creation tools we have explored in Thing 11 - what needs to happen for these tools to have much wider uptake?
