We wish to acknowledge Helene Blowers who created the original 23 Things (2006) and Michael Witt who developed <a href="https://www.rd-alliance.org/23-things-libraries-research-data-rdas-libraries-research-data-interest-group.html">23 Things: Libraries for Research Data</a> (2015), the Australian National Data Service (ANDS), who created their <a href="http://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/skills/23-research-data-things">23 (research data) Things</a> program in 2016, and the <a href="https://ucsdlib.github.io/23-Research-Data-Things/">UCSD Libraries' 23 (Research Data) Things</a> which they shared at the CA Data librarians meeting. The UCI Libraries version is based primarily on the ANDS version and some on the UCSD Libraries version with original content included.  We used the free version of Canvas to create an asychronous 8 week data training for library staff.

Research data comes in many shapes and sizes. Kick off your research data journey and start sharing your stories.

    * Getting started is for you if you are just beginning to learn about research data
    * Learn more is if you know a bit but want to know more
    * Challenge me is often more technical or assumes that you are familiar with at least the basics of managing and wrangling research data.
    
Do I have to do them all? No - you can pick'n'mix a different stream each week, or stay in one stream. See what Thing 1 has in store for you!
