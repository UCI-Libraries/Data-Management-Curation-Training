UCI Library Data Management & Curation Training

Research data comes in many shapes and sizes. Kick off your research data journey and start sharing your stories.

    Getting started is for you if you are just beginning to learn about research data
    Learn more is if you know a bit but want to know more
    Challenge me is often more technical or assumes that you are familiar with at least the basics of managing and wrangling research data.

Do I have to do them all? No - you can pick'n'mix a different stream each week, or stay in one stream. See what Thing 1 has in store for you!
