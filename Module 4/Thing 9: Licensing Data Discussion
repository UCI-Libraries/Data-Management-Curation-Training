Getting Started:

    If you were considering licensing a data set on something which may have commercial value to others - what license would you apply?

Learn More:

    Does your institution have a policy or guidelines around data licensing, if doesn't, should it?

Challenge Me:

    Assigning Open Licenses is not routine. Suggest one tip for encouraging uptake of 'open' licensing.
