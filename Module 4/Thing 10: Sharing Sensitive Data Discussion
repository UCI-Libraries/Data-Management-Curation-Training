Please let us know what level your post is addressing, i.e. Getting Started, Learn More, or Challenge Me.

**Getting Started:**

Imagine you are either a researcher or a participant in a health data survey:
    * Participant: what questions might you first ask the researcher about intended sharing and reuse of the survey data?
    * Researcher: What responses would you need to prepare to anticipate participants' questions about publishing “their data for all the world to see”?

**Learn More:**

    * What are your thoughts on the role of data gatekeepers, especially for sensitive data? What skills and knowledge do we need to protect sensitive data?

**Challenge Me:**

    * What are other some tools or resources you would recommend that could help a researcher de-identify or anonymize their data.
