2**Getting Started**  Many humanists hear "data" and assume they don't have it.  However, humanities scholars produce valuable data that may greatly contribute to their field.  Read the introduction below:

    *An Introduction to Humanities Data Curation  (http://guide.dhcuration.org/contents/intro/)

How does this introduction to data curation differ or doesn't differ from everything you have learned so far?

**Learn More** Humanities data repositories also exist. Explore one of the two repositories listed below:

    * Isidore: (http://www.rechercheisidore.fr/) a platform of search allowing the access to digital data of Humanities and Social Sciences. Open to all and especially to teachers, researchers, and students (including PhDs). It relies on the principles of Web of data and provides access to data in free access (open access).
    * Commons Open Repository Exchange (MLA CORE) (https://commons.mla.org/core/): a library-quality repository for sharing, discovering, retrieving, and archiving digital work. CORE provides MLA Commons members with a permanent, open access storage facility for their scholarly output, facilitating maximum discoverability and encouraging peer feedback.

Describe your findings. Are the humanities data repositories different than other repositories you have explored?

**Challenge Me** The term "Digital Humanities" does not have a hard and fast definition as of yet, but instead it refers to any humanities work that sets out to make use of digital tools to interpret and understand scholarship. This can take many forms, including:

    * Data Visualizations (e.g. Analysis of Latino Population in Houston, University of Houston Libraries (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nahJfvs16fU)
    * Textual statistical analysis
    * Using OCR tools to read previously illegible texts
    * Crowd-sourcing metadata (e.g., tagging, folksonomies, NYPL Menu Project (http://menus.nypl.org/)
    * Geo-rectification of archaeological sites from ancient scrolls
    * Word clouds (e.g, grouping Shakespeare's plays (http://www.aptv.org/IQLEARNING/ClassroomFiles/file/Shakespeare%20and%20Wordle.pdf)

Take a look at one of the following projects:

    * Mapping the Republic of Letters (Lhttp://republicofletters.stanford.edu/)
    * London Lives (Lhttps://www.londonlives.org/)
    * Charles Darwin's Library (http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/collection/darwinlibrary)

Try to find an About or Background page for the project you chose and consider these questions - What was the scope of the project? Can you tell how much content there is and what kind? What did it take to create the project? etc.
