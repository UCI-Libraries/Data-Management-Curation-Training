Please let us know what level your post is addressing, i.e. Getting Started, Learn More, or Challenge Me.

**Getting Started:**

    * Think about how data in the arts differs from the data you are familiar with. Discuss the similarities and differences.

**Learn More:**

    * Did the article you choose help you better understand research data in the creative arts or did it leave you with more questions?

**Challenge Me:**

   * When performing a data interview, would you talk to an artist differently than you would to a biologist? How would you change your approach? What do you think you still need to know in order to discuss data comfortably with an artist?
