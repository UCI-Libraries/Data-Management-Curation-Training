**Getting Started:**

    * Should DOIs be routinely applied to all research outputs? Remember that DOIs carry an expectation of persistence (maintenance costs, etc) but can provide be used to collect metrics as well as  link articles and data (evidence of impact.)

**Learn More:**

    * Do you think altmetrics for data have value in academic settings?  Why, or why not?

**Challenge Me:**

    * How easy was it to create the demo identifier? What do you think are the critical issues to ensure the persistence of DOIs over a number of years?
