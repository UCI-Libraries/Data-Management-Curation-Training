**Getting started** Data citation continues the tradition of acknowledging other peopleâ€™s work and ideas. Along with books, journals and other scholarly works, it is now possible to formally cite research datasets and even the software that was used to create or analyze the data.

    * Scan through the Introduction to Data Citation (Lhttps://dataverse.org/files/dataverseorg/files/force11-_jddcp_intro.pdf).
    * Now look at this record (http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.4q08q) in Dryad
        * The beauty of this record is that it shows other research outputs - in this case a publication - all of which are citable.
        * Review the data package scitation and see how familiar it is to other citation types?

If you have time, poke around Dryad repository to see how it has integrated citation of related articles and data.

Consider: data citation is a relatively new concept in the scholarly landscape and as yet, is not routinely done by researchers, or expected by most journals. What could be done to encourage routine citation of research data and software associated with research outputs?

**Learn More** The Force11 Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles are a set of principles for citing data. They are based on the premise that data citation, like the citation of other evidence and sources, is a good research practice and is part of the scholarly ecosystem supporting data reuse.

    * Since publication in 2014 the Principles have been endorsed by numerous individuals and more than 100 data centers, publishers and societies.
    * Start by reading the Force11 Principles (https://www.force11.org/group/joint-declaration-data-citation-principles-final).
    * Then browse the list of people and organizations that have endorsed the Principles (https://www.force11.org/datacitation/endorsements).

Consider: Given such support and clear direction, why do you think data citation has not been uniformly adopted, so far, across all disciplines?

**Challenge Me** Are some data formats more likely to be cited? It has become a lot simpler to mine data and interpret insights in an engaging, attractive and easy to understand way. Does this make the data more or less accessible, reusable and therefore citable?

    * Go to this list, from econsultancy.com (https://econsultancy.com/blog/66131-17-visualisation-tools-to-make-your-data-beautiful/)., of various free and premium tools and platforms for creating interactive charts, infographics, maps and word clouds.
    * Choose one tool and delve into the detail.
    * If you want to get hands on, work through this infogr.am tutorial (https://infogr.am/tutorial/getting-started/getting-started-with-infogram/). to create a data visualisation using your own data or the titanic passenger dataset they have provided.

Consider: What are 3 of your likes or dislikes about the tool you explored? What is your opinion about whether publishing data as a visualization is likely to make the data more or less accessible, reusable and therefore citable.
