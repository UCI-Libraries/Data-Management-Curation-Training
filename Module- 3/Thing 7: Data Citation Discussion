Getting Started:

    Data citation is a relatively new concept in the scholarly landscape and as yet, is not routinely done by researchers, or expected by most journals.  What could be done to encourage routine citation of research data and software associated with research outputs?

Learn More:

    Given such support and clear direction, why do you think data citation has not been uniformly adopted, so far, across all disciplines?

Challenge Me:

    What are 3 of your likes or dislikes about the tool you explored?  What is your opinion about whether publishing data as a visualization is likely to make the data more or less accessible, reusable and therefor citable?
