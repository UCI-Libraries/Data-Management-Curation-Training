**Getting Started** Apps and APIs are tools which make data much more discoverable and usable for all of us - not just researchers! You can choose to explore both Apps and APIs or just one.

Option 1: How are APIs used with data?

APIs are important for research data because they are used by developers to cleverly make data more discoverable and reusable, e.g., the Google Maps API is very widely used to record the exact location of a species or photograph and lets developers embed Google Maps on webpages.

1. Start by watching this easy, short (3.24 min) video, What is an API? (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY).

2. Metadata records often show at least 2 different APIs in action. Interview material from Western Sydney women's oral history project: 'From farms to freeways: Women's memories of Western Sydney's (https://researchdata.ands.org.au/interview-material-western-western-sydney/561264/) metadata record shows both:

    * Google Maps API for the area map (zoom in to see the exact location where the data was collected)
    * Views and Accesses API

3. Trove at the National Library of Australia uses APIs to showcase National Library of Australia collections in amazing ways. Check out the Trove Applications Galley (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. to see some clever uses of Trove APIs.

Just for fun: Stay in the Trove Applications Galley (http://help.nla.gov.au/trove/building-with-trove/application-gallery) to find out what was making news today in history?

Option 2: Apps for researchers and citizen scientists (is that you?)

Oftentimes several APIs underpin a (software) App(lication) (program). Data gatherers in the field use apps to make data collection easier, more accurate, and more rich, e.g., filling out data forms offline on their smartphones or tablets; capturing images, photos, videos, and sounds; tracking locations on maps (probably using the Google Map API), and much more. They're flexible tools that can help researchers gather more information faster and work more effectively.

Explore one or both of these links:

    * Scroll down to the list of the 10 of the Best Apps for Gathering Data in the Field (https://zapier.com/learn/ultimate-guide-to-forms-and-surveys/best-data-collection-apps/). Check out uses and associated costs.
    * Scroll down to the list of 8 Apps That Turn Citizens into Scientists (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/8-apps-that-turn-citizens-into-scientists/) - US apps that can be used globally.

**Learn More** Get hands on with APIs and Queries. Trove (http://trove.nla.gov.au/) is a free discovery service provided by the National Library of Australia. It provides access to millions of Australian resources including newspaper articles, images, and manuscripts. The Trove API enables people to create new applications, tools, and interfaces using the rich store of Trove data.

1. Start by browsing around the Trove Application Gallery () for some of the creative ways people have used the Trove API. Be inspired!

2. To see more of the power of one API, watch this short (3:09 min) video, Ask Trove (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMkGlOYvz8I). The screen is a bit fuzzy but you can get the idea of this innovative “use your voice to query Trove” API.

If you have time to get hands on:

3. Browse the introduction (http://help.nla.gov.au/trove/building-with-trove) to the Trove API (http://help.nla.gov.au/trove/building-with-trove/api).

4. Go the Trove API Console (Lhttp://troveconsole.herokuapp.com/) and click on some of the example searches provided. The results are in a machine readable format - look closely and you can see the citation details, e.g., title, date, heading, pageSequence, etc.

5. Try constructing your own API query to see what results you get. Note: If you want to use them in your own code you'll need to get an API key and add "&key=[Your API key]" to the URL.

**Challenge Me** APIs and Apps are the transformation agents which make data and services powerful and accessible. These 2 options give you a chance to see how APIs can be applied to either data or services.

Option 1: Hands-on API tutorials
Are you new to APIs and want a hands-on introduction to commonly used APIs, including Twitter and YouTube? Choose one API from the Code Academy APIs (Lhttps://www.codecademy.com/apis) page and work through the online tutorial to learn more about the API you chose.

Option 2: APIs for Australian National Data Services (ANDS)

Explore one of these APIs to get a feel for what the API does and whether it may be useful to your organization:

    * OAI PMH Provider (http://developers.ands.org.au/services/collections-registry-api/oai/): use this API if your system is a harvester which is compatible with the OAI-PMH protocol.
    * Research Activity Grants API (http://developers.ands.org.au/services/research-activity-api/): provides machine access to research activity information contributed to Research Data Australia (https://researchdata.ands.org.au/) such as grants and projects. This is a lightweight method to query the ANDS Registry for specific information about research activity.
