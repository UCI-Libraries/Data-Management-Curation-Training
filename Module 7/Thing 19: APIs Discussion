Please let us know what level your post is addressing, i.e., Getting Started, Learn More, or Challenge Me.

**Getting Started:**

   * Most of us have used public transport apps and APIs - think about the source of the data which enables real-time transport information to be presented to you via an easy-to-use app or API.

**Learn More:**

    * Share your thoughts on how APIs could make data more exciting and accessible for more people. Was your code query successful? How could you get different results by varying the query?

 **Challenge Me:**

    * Option 1: Hands-on API tutorials
        * How could the APIs be applied to a dataset to make it more reusable?
    * Option 2: APIs for Australian National Data Services (ANDS)
        * How could these APIs be applied to repository services at your institution?
