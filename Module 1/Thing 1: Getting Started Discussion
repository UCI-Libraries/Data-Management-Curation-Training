Getting Started:

    * Open up one of these collections:
        * Look over an Introduction to Research Data Management (https://www.imperial.ac.uk/research-and-innovation/support-for-staff/scholarly-communication/research-data-management/introduction-to-research-data-management) from Imperial College London.
        * Watch this video on research data produced by University of California Librarians (5min): https://youtu.be/Lr722k7NyGU">https://youtu.be/Lr722k7NyGU.
    * Write down the specific data formats, software used, and whether the collection has a code book or data dictionary. If you arenâ€™t familiar with the data formats or software codes, try a web search and see if you can figure out what it is. Capture your findings.
    * Explore the metadata representing the collection. Besides the title and description, what other elements are described?
    * Also, how does complexity and range of data formats affect access and re-use possibilities?
    Note: You do not need to download the data associated with these files, instead review the records to see if you can answer the questions above.

    * Research data comes in a variety of forms and in order to effectively use data researchers must include appropriate supporting materials.  For this exercise use one of the following data sources:
        * DASH (https://dash.lib.uci.edu/stash)
        * openICPSR (https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/)
        * USGS Water Data (https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis)
        * DataCite (https://www.datacite.org/index.html)
    * A dataset that you have produced in the course of your own research.
    * Another research dataset available online through a data repository of your choice.
    * Think about how the data here differs from data you are familiar with. Consider for example, format, size and access method.
    * Record your reflections and please provide the name and a link to the dataset you chose.

Challenge Me:

Answer one of the following questions:
    * Your favorite research data tech, software story or experience?
    * A software tool or service for research data you think others might be interested in?
    * A question or research data problem to crowd source a solution?
    * Conduct a personal audit on what data technical skills you have, and what skills you want to learn.
