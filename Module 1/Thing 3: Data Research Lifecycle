**Getting Started**  Data often have a longer lifespan than the research project that creates them. Follow-up projects may analyze or add to the data, and data may be reused by other researchers.  Journal publishers are increasingly mandating that the data underpinning a journal article be retained and made accessible for the long term.A data life cycle shows the different phases a data set goes through as the research project moves from "having a brilliant idea" to "making ground breaking discoveries" to "telling the world about it."

    * Take a look at the UK Data Archive Research Data Lifecycle (http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/create-manage/life-cycle)
    * Click on each of the pink circles to see what happens with data at each stage of the life cycle.
    * How does this mesh with your understanding of the research lifecycle?

**Learn More** Research Lifecycle Models provide a high-level overview of the stages and actions during the research lifecycle required for successful management of data.

    * Take a look at the DCC Curation Lifecycle Model (http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/curation-lifecycle-model). which concentrates on      preservation and curation within data management.
    * What modification or addition would you include to make this model contextualized to your situation?

**Challenge Me** Data management is likely to be the most effective when it is integrated into existing system-wide research and administrative processes. New software and products are being developed particularly with this in mind.

    * Scan through this guide to Research Data Management in Practice (PDF, 0.74 MB) (http://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/394056/research-data-management-in-practice.pdf).
    * Look carefully at Figure 1 Key Steps in Research Data Management, Section 3: Steps in Research Data Management.
    * What are the emerging opportunities for institutions to integrate management systems for their research data assets?
