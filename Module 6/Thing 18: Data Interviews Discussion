Respond to the prompts below according to the section you worked on.  Please let us know what level your post is addressing, i.e., Getting Started, Learn More, or Challenge Me.

Getting Started:

    What are some ideas you may have for conversation starters? (e.g., Do you have a question? Want to share a resource?)

Learn More:

    Option 1: Interviews to collect metadata
        What's the value of this toolkit to you? Compare it to other interview toolkits you know of.
    Option 2: Interviews which explore data management practice
        Choose one question to which you believe a researcher may not know how to respond. What would you do to support the researcher with the concepts in this question?

 Challenge Me:

    Option 1: Geophysics and Seismology / Structural Geology and Neotectonics
        Given the data owners want this data to be open, what would you advise to include in the metadata to ensure the reuse of this data is possible?
    Option 2: Sociology / Demographics
        What options would you offer a researcher to achieve his or her high and medium priorities? What potential solution/s would you recommend?
