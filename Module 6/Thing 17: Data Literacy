**Getting Started** We all have a role to play in building a world of data literate citizens.

    * Enjoy this quirky and clever 1.48-min video from a cartoonist:
    What is data literacy (https://youtu.be/qHz_ogTH2p4).
     
    * Choose one of the sites from the list below. As you look around the site, think about how you might use these ideas to "grow" your, or other people’s, data literacy:
        * For Universities and research institutes: Curtin University (http://libguides.library.curtin.edu.au/research-data-management). 
        * For Federal, State or Local Govt: Publishing your data from US data.gov (https://www.data.gov/).
        * For Business: Open data that drives business (http://theodi.org/open-data-that-drives-business) (UK, 2015) or US data.gov Business section (https://www.data.gov/business/).
        * For teachers and school librarians: Resources for educators (http://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/publishing-and-reusing-data/data-in-education) to find data repositories which have teaching materials
        * For lecturers: 9 case studies (http://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/385019/teaching-with-research-data-report.pdf) (page 13-17) of how research data is used in various curricula from Teaching with Research Data: Report to the Australian National Data Service (ANDS), August 2015
        * For librarians: A list of 10 recommendations (http://libereurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/The%20research%20data%20group%202012%20v7%20final.pdf) from LIBER for libraries to get started with research data management

**Learn More** People have very diverse needs in terms of what data literacy means for them.

Choose one or two from the list below and explore “data literacy” from the perspectives of these diverse roles:

    * Librarians: What is Data Literacy? (http://databrarians.org/2015/02/what-is-data-literacy/) (from databrarians.org)
    * Entrepreneurs: Data Literacy -- What It Is And Why None of Us Have It (http://www.forbes.com/sites/homaycotte/2014/10/28/data-literacy-what-it-is-and-why-none-of-us-have-it/#325ab5c951d3) (from Forbes Magazine)
    * Political science students: Data Literacy and Data Visualization (Lhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/course/data-literacy-data-visualization/id693097601) - Lecture 1: Introduction (note: you need iTunes)
    * Writers, journalists: Become Data Literate in 3 Simple Steps (http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/understanding_data_0.html)
    * Teachers and high school students: Data Literacy is Essential to Modern Society (https://youtu.be/4ei7BUMQl5c)
     (Video 3.51mins, published 2016 by MIT Industrial Liaison Program)
    * Citizens: Open data for accountable governance: Is data literacy the key to citizen engagement? (http://thegovlab.org/open-data-for-accountable-governance-is-data-literacy-the-key-to-citizen-engagement/)

**Challenge Me** Technical data wrangling skills are fast becoming a new form of data literacy.  The four Carpentry concepts listed below have really taken off over the past couple of years.

The “one hour a week” model for 23 Things doesn’t allow enough time to do any of the Carpentry modules since most of them need at least several hours to complete, but here’s a chance for you to find out what all the Carpentry buzz is about.

Have a look at this Environmental scan (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZASH-NhsvXnyZNJkGzFNFp5_adn6Q-iX2N-tbv1Apbw/edit#gid=0) of courses offering data skills. Then choose one Carpentry to explore in depth or browse over them all:

    Data Carpentry (http://www.datacarpentry.org/)
    Library Carpentry (http://librarycarpentry.github.io/about/)
    Software Carpentry (http://software-carpentry.org/)
    Author Carpentry (https://authorcarpentry.github.io/)

We will get more hands-on with Carpentry in Thing 21.
