23things_gettingstarted_big.jpg A Data Management Plan (DMP) documents how data will be managed, stored, and shared during and after a research project. Some research funders are now requesting that researchers submit a DMP as part of their project proposal:

    Start by scanning this short introduction to Data Management Plans (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site..
    Now browse through some public DMPs from either CDL or DataOne, and open up one or two of the DMPs to see the type of information they capture:
        California Digital Library (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.
        DataOne (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.

 23things_learnmore_small  Preparing a Data Management Plan (DMP) can be complex and should be done at the start of the project. DMP templates are now freely available for reuse by various institutions.

    Download a couple of public DMPs from the NEH DMP page (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. and scan through them.
    Which Library or eResearch infrastructure/tools could a Digital Humanities researcher use in their plan?

23things_challengeme_small Data Management Plans from successful grant applications to the US National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) have been made public via popular demand and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.

Choose one DMP template or guide from the US, international, or discipline examples from the DMPTool DMP Requirements page (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. to assist yourself in drafting a dummy DMP.

Consider: Should libraries also create DMP's for data projects within their libraries?  Next time you have a project using and/or creating data will you consider creating a DMP?
