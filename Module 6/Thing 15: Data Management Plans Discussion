Please let us know what level your post is addressing, i.e., Getting Started, Learn More, or Challenge Me.

**Getting Started:**

    * You will have noticed that DMPs can be very short, or extremely long and complex. What do you think are the two or three pieces of information essential to include in every DMP and why that is?

 **Learn More:**

    * Do any of these DMPs resonate with your experience? Share what that is (e.g., good/bad practice, realistic/unrealistic goals)

 **Challenge Me:**

    * Should libraries also create DMP's for data projects within their libraries?  Next time you have a project using and/or creating data will you consider creating a DMP?
