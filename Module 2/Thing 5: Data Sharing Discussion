**Getting Started:**

    * Why isn’t data more publicly accessible or more ‘open’?

**Learn More:**

    Do you think there are differences between disciplines and countries - what changes to these statistics would you expect between 2014 and now?

**Challenge Me:**

    * Have you, or would you, use any of these tools? How feasible it is to expect such preservation tools to be widely used?
